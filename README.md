## Introduction
![webpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80071604/139555571-6aeffcc5-7715-43af-96ba-6847d95fa8c3.png)
* Welcome to my first website! In this project I tried to mix my personal profile with my Call Of Duty journey, talking about when I started to 
code, some feautures about me and of course, some stats in CoD :). 
  * If you wanna check out this project just `git clone https://github.com/Jorgedeveloopzz/MiPrimeraPagina.git` or donwload the ZIP and then open it in your browser. 
(Firefox based web browsers preferibly).

## Objectives
* The main reason why I started this project was to learn Frontend development, especially to learn Javascript but to be honest, I learnt very little. In fact,
JS only represents 19'5% of the final code, althought it's been enough to learn the basics of the lenguage. On the other hand, I've learned too much of CSS and HTML.

## Why is it unfinished?
* For the future I want to learn backend, and this would be good beggining to start in the part of the "stats" to add date bases and make consults. I have some ideas to that.

## Next project in mind
* Now I'm going to make typical project to learn JS, a task list, which I expect to get better in Frontend development and learn more Javascript.
