* Welcome to my first website! In this project I tried to mix my personal profile with my Call Of Duty journey, talking about when I started to 
code, some feautures about me and of course, some stats in CoD :). 
  * If you wanna check out this project just `git clone https://github.com/Jorgedeveloopzz/MiPrimeraPagina.git` 
or donwload the ZIP and then open it in your browser. (Firefox based web browsers preferibly).

## Objectives
* The main reason why I started this project was to learn Frontend development, especially to learn Javascript but to be honest, I learnt very little. In fact,
JS only represents 23,1% of the final code, althought it's been enough to learn the basics of the lenguage. On the other hand, I've learned too much of CSS and HTML.
